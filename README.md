# Random story
A not-so-random story generator

## What is Random Story?
Random Story is a simple story generator that creates... well, not-so-random stories. It's a fun little project that can help you stimulate your creativity or simply entertain you.

## Get started
To use Random Story, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository :`git clone https://github.com/FireBallGithub/random-story.git`
Install the requirements :`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the code.
That's it! The generator will create a new story for you. You can run the code several times to generate different stories.

## How it works
The generator uses a combination of predefined story elements and basic logic to create a new story each time you run the code. It's not exactly random, but it's still fun to see what kind of story it comes up with!

## Contributor
If you'd like to contribute to Random Story, feel free to create the repository and submit a pull request. You can help improve the generator by adding new story elements, fine-tuning the logic or even creating a graphical interface.
